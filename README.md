# Titan Control Center - Anomaly Detection

The [Titan Control Center](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2020.100050)
is a scalable and extensible analytics platform for [Industrial DevOps](https://industrial-devops.org/en).
It analyzes and visualizes data streams from Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors
(e.g. electrical power consumption) in industrial production.

This repository contains the **Anomaly Detection** microservice of the Titan Control Center.

## Build and Run

We use Gradle as a build tool. In order to build the executeables run 
`./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS or `./gradlew.bat build` on Windows. This will
create the file `build/distributions/titanccp-anomaly-detection.tar` which contains
start scripts for Linux/macOS and Windows.

This repository also contains a Dockerfile. Run
`docker build -t titan-ccp-anomaly-detection .` to create a container from it (after
building it with Gradle).
